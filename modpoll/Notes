Questions:

1 - Can we remotly enable automode?  page 16 register 8 Write system control keys - 35700
2 - How to determine not in auto?
3 - How can we get access to the error codes displayed on the Scada alarms page
    http://192.168.2.51/?dse=alarms

4- Is the gencom_get.cgi webpage on the scada mimic page documented for public use?
5 - It appers that many value are disabled. Is it possible that our generator supplyers (winco and Taylor)
decided to not implement many of them. For example: The engine can shutdown due to low oil level,
but the oil pressure is avaiable on the taylor but not the winco. Same for coolant temperture.



5) These are the Alarms that bluepillar provides.  How can we find them with modbus
Common Alarm
Emergency Stop
High Battery Volts
High Engine Temp
Low Battery Volts
Low Coolant Temp
Oil Pressure Low
Overcrank
Overspeed
Pre High Engine Temp
Pre Low Oil Pressure
Running
Shutdown Alarm

Warning Alarm


onChangeReset will determine how many second between mantitory pushes of non changed values

Q: 10.7 Page 5 â€“ Extended Instrumentation
Does not appear to be working
Interested in  '128 Engine operating state'

Q: Where do i find Running and Supplying load -

Q: on the gencom pages - are the possible events the same that are found in other locations?
If its there were not guarentted it will work for this generator?



Question for bp
What is common alarm - is it a common alarm for any of the other settings
